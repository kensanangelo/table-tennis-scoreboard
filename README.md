# BV Scoreboard
## About
Built on the MERN stack, the client files will be run on a small computer on the TV next to the ping pong table to track games. The server will be run as an API the local files connect to. 2 USB paddle buttons will be mapped to Z and P for each player, and a mouse will be used to set up the game.

## Setup
- You have to run npm install in root and /client separately before using any commands (they have separate node_module folders)

## Scripts
- Run `npm start` to start both the react build and server with live reloading
- Run `npm run server` to only run the server with live reloading
- Run `npm run build` to build the react app for deployment
- Run `npm run prod` to run the server for the production environment

## TODO
- Add to game start screen
	- How many points to win & serving switch amount?
- Maybe a way to modify scores in game if someone messes up
- Add stats analysis
